      <description>What Is It? Boost.Test is a C++ header-only library for easily creating unit tests and providing developers with some of the common testing components. It&amp;rsquo;s part of the Boost collection of libraries that are free and open source.
How Do I Set It Up? In the simple case, it&amp;rsquo;s as easy as installing the Boost development headers from your package manager (e.g. yum install boost-devel) and then the headers should be accessible in the default system paths.</description>
